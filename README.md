Python Programming for GIS 
Manipulating LANDSAT imagery 
This code enables you to summarize Landsat imagery based on pixel to provide you with an .xls chart with the different types of land use.  It will also help you composite the images and clip the data to your AOI.  
The chart will contain the number of pixel that belong to each land use type. 
First, you need to download the data and unzip the files twice. (do not change the names) 
-	The code will run and compose all the bands together
-	It will clip it to your Area of Interest 
-	It will run and unsupervised classification to the classes in the AOI. ( my images have 5 classes ) 
-	And lastly, it will summarize, based on pixel, the different types of land use 
I worked on this code provided by my colleague Ka Kit Liu. For our research project, we analyzed images of the Lake Lanier Watershed located in North Georgia.
